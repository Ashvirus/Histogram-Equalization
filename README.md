# Histogram-Equalization
Histogram Equalization is a process to increase the contrast of gray-scale
Image. We can see in (Figure) that Histogram of gray-scale image is unevenly
distributed. If we can normalize it such that all pixels have normalized Intensity
then Image is Equalized (Pixels are evenly distributed).

Stpes to run the code:
1. Open MATLAB and select path, where fn_HistogramEqualization.m file is stored.
2. Now give the image name as 'example.jpg'.
3. 3. Run the code and see the result.
